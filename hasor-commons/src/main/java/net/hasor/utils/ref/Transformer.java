/**
 * Defines a functor interface implemented by classes that transform one

 * A <code>Transformer</code> converts the input object to the output object.
 * The input object should be left unchanged.
 * Transformers are typically used for type conversions, or extracting data
 * from an object.
 * <p>
 * Standard implementations of common transformers are provided by
 * TransformerUtils. These include method invokation, returning a constant,
 * cloning and returning the string value.
