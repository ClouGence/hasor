<BODY BGCOLOR="white">

An SMTP protocol provider for the JavaMail API
that provides access to an SMTP server.
Refer to <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc821.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 821</A>
for more information.
<P>
When sending a message, detailed information on each address that
fails is available in an
{@link com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPAddressFailedException SMTPAddressFailedException}
chained off the top level
{@link javax.mail.SendFailedException SendFailedException}
that is thrown.
In addition, if the <code>mail.smtp.reportsuccess</code> property
is set, an
{@link com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPAddressSucceededException
SMTPAddressSucceededException}
will be included in the list for each address that is successful.
Note that this will cause a top level
{@link javax.mail.SendFailedException SendFailedException}
to be thrown even though the send was successful.
<P>
The SMTP provider also supports ESMTP
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1651.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 1651</A>).
It can optionally use SMTP Authentication 
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2554.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 2554</A>)
using the LOGIN, PLAIN, and DIGEST-MD5 mechanisms
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2592.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 2592</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2831.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 2831</A>).
<P>
To use SMTP authentication you'll need to set the <code>mail.smtp.auth</code>
property (see below) and provide the SMTP Transport
with a username and password when connecting to the SMTP server.  You
can do this using one of the following approaches:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Provide an Authenticator object when creating your mail Session
and provide the username and password information during the
Authenticator callback.
<P>
Note that the <code>mail.smtp.user</code> property can be set to provide a
default username for the callback, but the password will still need to be
supplied explicitly.
<P>
This approach allows you to use the static Transport <code>send</code> method
to send messages.
</LI>
<P>
<LI>
Call the Transport <code>connect</code> method explicitly with username and
password arguments.
<P>
This approach requires you to explicitly manage a Transport object
and use the Transport <code>sendMessage</code> method to send the message.
The transport.java demo program demonstrates how to manage a Transport
object.  The following is roughly equivalent to the static
Transport <code>send</code> method, but supplies the needed username and
password:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Transport tr = session.getTransport("smtp");
tr.connect(smtphost, username, password);
msg.saveChanges();	// don't forget this
tr.sendMessage(msg, msg.getAllRecipients());
tr.close();
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
When using DIGEST-MD5 authentication,
you'll also need to supply an appropriate realm;
your mail server administrator can supply this information.
You can set this using the <code>mail.smtp.sasl.realm</code> property,
or the <code>setSASLRealm</code> method on <code>SMTPTransport</code>.
<P>
SMTP can also optionally request Delivery Status Notifications
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1891.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 1891</A>).
The delivery status will typically be reported using
a "multipart/report"
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1892.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 1892</A>)
message type with a "message/delivery-status"
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1894.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 1894</A>)
part.
JavaMail does not currently provide direct support for these new MIME types,
but you can process them as any other "multipart" or "message" content,
using <code>MimeMultipart</code> and <code>MimeMessage</code> objects.
<P>
See below for the properties to enable these features.
<P>
Note also that <strong>THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION HERE TO USE THESE
FEATURES!!!</strong>  You will need to read the appropriate RFCs mentioned above
to understand what these features do and how to use them.  Don't just
start setting properties and then complain to us when it doesn't work
like you expect it to work.  <strong>READ THE RFCs FIRST!!!</strong>
<P>
The SMTP protocol provider supports the following properties,
which may be set in the JavaMail <code>Session</code> object.
The properties are always set as strings; the Type column describes
how the string is interpreted.  For example, use
<PRE>
	props.put("mail.smtp.port", "888");
</PRE>
to set the <CODE>mail.smtp.port</CODE> property, which is of type int.

<TD>
Local address (host name) to bind to when creating the SMTP socket.

for 8bit text.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.smtp.sendpartial</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to true, and a message has some valid and some invalid

a SendFailedException.  If set to false (the default), the message is
not sent to any of the recipients if there is an invalid recipient
address.

for the response to the QUIT command.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.smtp.reportsuccess</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to true, causes the transport to include an
{@link com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPAddressSucceededException

to be thrown from the
{@link com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPTransport#sendMessage sendMessage}
method of
{@link com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPTransport SMTPTransport}
even if all addresses were correct and the message was sent
successfully.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.smtp.socketFactory.class</TD>
<TD>String</TD>
<TD>
If set, specifies the name of a class that implements the

</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.smtp.socketFactory.port</TD>

<TD>String</TD>
<TD>
Extension string to append to the MAIL command.
The extension string can be used to specify standard SMTP
service extensions as well as vendor-specific extensions.
Typically the application should use the
{@link com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPTransport SMTPTransport}
method {@link com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPTransport#supportsExtension
supportsExtension}
to verify that the server supports the desired service extension.
See <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1869.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 1869</A>
and other RFCs that define specific extensions.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.smtp.starttls.enable</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If true, enables the use of the <code>STARTTLS</code> command (if
supported by the server) to switch the connection to a TLS-protected
connection before issuing any login commands.  Note that an appropriate
trust store must configured so that the client will trust the server's
certificate.
Defaults to false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.smtp.userset</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to true, use the RSET command instead of the NOOP command
in the {@link javax.mail.Transport#isConnected isConnected} method.
In some cases sendmail will respond slowly after many NOOP commands;
use of RSET avoids this sendmail issue.
Defaults to false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.smtp.ssl.protocols</TD>
<TD>string</TD>
<TD>
Specifies the SSL protocols that will be enabled for SSL connections.

<TD>mail.smtp.ssl.ciphersuites</TD>
<TD>string</TD>
<TD>

The property value is a whitespace separated list of tokens acceptable
to the <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket.setEnabledCipherSuites</code> method.
</TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>
<P>
In general, applications should not need to use the classes in this
package directly.  Instead, they should use the APIs defined by
<code>javax.mail</code> package (and subpackages).  Applications should
never construct instances of <code>SMTPTransport</code> directly.
Instead, they should use the
<code>Session</code> method <code>getTransport</code> to acquire an
appropriate <code>Transport</code> object.
<P>
<strong>WARNING:</strong> The APIs unique to this package should be
considered <strong>EXPERIMENTAL</strong>.  They may be changed in the
future in ways that are incompatible with applications using the
current APIs.
